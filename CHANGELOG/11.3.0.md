- [#1284] handle very simple joins using $lookup when the backend is >= MongoDB 3.2
   - works only for "trivial" joins where the condition is a simple equality relation between fields and there is no filtering on either side
   - fall back to map-reduce in all other cases
   - no checking of referenced collections; will fail if they are sharded
